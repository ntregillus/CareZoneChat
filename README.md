# CareZoneChat

This is a basic, memory only chat app that supports:
-- lurkers (anonymous watchers!)
-- notifications of name changes along side messages
-- typing indicators

using:
-- Node.js
-- express
-- socket.io
-- angular.js

to keep things simple:
server.js contains all server side code
client.js contains all client side code
